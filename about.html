          <h2>about me</h2>
          <p>My interest in programming sparked early on, at the age of 12. Shortly before turning 13,
          I published my first apps on the Google Play store. </p>
          <p>I continued to develop Android apps for a while, however I gradually began to shift
            my horizons with a new focus in Python and Web Development. Since then, I have been
          sharpening my skills in all of these subjects while continuing to acquire new
        skills, many of which came with my first business that I launched in 2020, DroneConnect.</p>
        <p>I currently have several businesses in the works that involve the financial
          as well as supplement industries.</p>
          <p>As I seek to continue to utilize my programming skills as well as improve them
            further, I am always open to new opportunities, projects, or collaboration of any
            kind, please reach out to me at <a href="#" id="email">valievventures@gmail.com</a></p>
