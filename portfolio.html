          <p>As of late, my main focus has been in web development and work on several businesses.
          I recently (May 2021) completely redesigned this website using Bootstrap and new
          web design skills that I have acquired.</p>
          <p>I have also been working on several businesses,
          one of which is freelance services that I now offer including <span class="bold">
          websites starting at $500</span> as well as businesses I am
          starting in the finance, health supplement, and nutrition industries. I have most recently
          been working with a local highly succesful entreprenuer, Jonathan Bomser.</p>

          <h3>2019-2020 - Business, Marketing, Web Development - DroneConnect</h3>
          <p>Myself and a friend of mine, Daniel Griffith, started DroneConnect
          in late 2019. It was an ecommerce website based on a dropshipping-style
          business model. I was responsible for creating and maintaing the custom Shopify website,
          as well as managing the social media prescence, including Facebook advertising campaigns
          that were able to <span class="bold">drive CTR from 4%-11%, as well as a 2% conversion rate.</span></p>
          <p>Although the business was succesful in generating profits, my co-founder and I
          agreed the model was not sustainable, scalable, or something we were
          passionate about. For this reason we closed DroneConnect in late 2020.</p>

          <p>I worked with a Cannabis delivery service named Five Star Edibles
          from late 2018 - mid 2019. I was responsible for creating the custom Shopify website,
          managing Facebook campaigns, as well as assisting in branding and maintenance
          of social media platforms. Although <span class="bold">we were quite succesful in driving
          sales through expansion and advertising on online platforms</span>, issues in
          other areas of the founders business model came up, leading to his discontinuation
          of the service.</p>

          <p>In 2018 I began to become closely involved in my local skateboarding
          community. As a regular in the community, I became close friends with
          the owner of the local skate shop Asphalt Assault, Clinton Abbot, whom
          I offered to create a website for. We were able to establish him a solid
          online prescence, <span class="bold">bringing new customers to the shop as well as providing
          a centralized location for updates as well as hours.</span>

          <h3>2018 - Python and Web Development - M2 Labs</h3>
          <p>During the summer of 2018, I worked with a senior developer at PNNL, Michael Akopov, to
          create an application named Git Hired. The project <span class="bold">analyzed the GIT
          repositories of a user and provide information about their contributions
          such as languages used, % of contributions, and many other details.</span> Although
          we succesfully developed the Python program as well as a website for it,
          Michael informed me that due to family commitments with increased workload,
          he would no longer be able to continue this project with me. </p>

          <p>I spent most of 2017 focusing on learning and growing my web development
          skills with Bootstrap as well as Java. I was able to utilize my skills in several school
          projects, such as the Inauthentic Learning project, which addressed core issues
          of the school system, where many students "learn" a topic to only forget it
          soon after the test date.</p>

          <p>In 2016, <span class="bold">at the age of 12</span>, I published my first apps on the
          Google Play Store. This was my first real venture into programming.
          </p>
          <p>
          I created two soundboard based apps as well as a wifi manager, which
          have accumulated <span class="bold">over 15K downloads</span> on the Google Play Store. These
          downloads were accumulated with 0 marketing, other than my promotion
          of the app to a few friends at my school.
